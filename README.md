<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Given a webpage that meets accessibility standards, I view the source code to make sure it meets the semantic HTML elements.I viewed. the structure of the HTML elements and find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning. When viewing the icon and image elements, I make sure there are accessible alt attributes. Then taking a look at the heading attributes; I find that they fall in sequential order. I view the title element, and I find a concise, descriptive title.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities can't access their website.
